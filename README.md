# Cakes Tech Test
To run the app:
- Ensure that you have a terminal open in the root of the solution
- Run command `docker-compose up -d` to start the deployment process
- Web front end is now available at http://localhost:8080
- API will be available at http://localhost:8082
- MongoDB management admin available at http://localhost:8081

The app can also be run in development mode in Visual Studio etc.
Although the assumption here is that you either have MongoDB running in a container or installed locally running on the standard port of 27017 (usually localhost).
